# Deployment Resources for Arctic Ice Solutions

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive deployment resources for the Arctic Ice Solutions frontend using Devin Apps Platform.

## Current Deployment Status

### ✅ Successfully Deployed
- **Current URL**: https://frontend-deployment-app-0vfk8kvg.devinapps.com
- **Status**: Live and accessible
- **Platform**: Devin Apps Platform
- **Backend API**: https://api.yourchoiceice.com

### ❌ Custom Domain Configuration Issue - CRITICAL
- **Target Domain**: https://yourchoiceice.com
- **Current Issue**: Certificate error (ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID) - Domain not accessible
- **App ID**: `ice-management-app-4r16aafs` (configured in devin.appconfig.json)
- **Root Cause**: `deploy_frontend` command creates new deployments instead of using configured app ID
- **Impact**: Site accessible at generated URL instead of yourchoiceice.com as required

### Environment Configuration
Production environment variables are configured in `devin.appconfig.json`:
```json
{
  "appId": "ice-management-app-4r16aafs",
  "environments": {
    "production": {
      "envVars": {
        "VITE_API_URL": "https://api.yourchoiceice.com",
        "VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY": "$GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  },
  "domains": ["yourchoiceice.com"]
}
```

## Deployment Process

### 1. Build Frontend Locally
```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### 2. Deploy to Devin Apps Platform
Use the deploy_frontend command with the built assets:
```bash
# Deploy the dist directory to Devin Apps Platform
deploy_frontend dir="/path/to/frontend/dist"
```

### 3. Current Deployment Results
- ✅ **Deployed URL**: https://frontend-deployment-app-0vfk8kvg.devinapps.com
- ✅ **Frontend Loading**: Arctic Ice Solutions login page displays correctly
- ✅ **Demo Credentials**: All user roles visible on login page
- ⚠️ **API Connectivity**: Login attempts return "Invalid username or password"
- ❌ **Custom Domain**: yourchoiceice.com shows certificate error

### 4. CRITICAL ISSUE: Custom Domain Configuration
**Problem**: The `deploy_frontend` command creates new deployments with generated URLs instead of using the configured app ID that has the custom domain setup.

**Current Status**:
- ❌ yourchoiceice.com returns certificate error (ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID)
- ❌ Site only accessible at generated URL: https://frontend-deployment-app-0vfk8kvg.devinapps.com
- ✅ App ID `ice-management-app-4r16aafs` configured in devin.appconfig.json with yourchoiceice.com domain
- ✅ Frontend builds correctly with production API URL

**Required Solution**:
1. Use Devin Apps Platform API or CLI to deploy to specific app ID instead of creating new deployments
2. Configure SSL certificate for yourchoiceice.com domain in Devin platform
3. Verify domain ownership and DNS configuration
4. Test that yourchoiceice.com serves the application correctly

**User Impact**: User frustrated with weeks of domain switching issues - needs permanent yourchoiceice.com setup to avoid "going round and round again"

## Automated Deployment Scripts

### Force Rebuild Script
Location: `scripts/force-rebuild.sh`

This script provides manual deployment automation:
- Updates environment variables via Devin API
- Triggers rebuild with cache clearing
- Monitors deployment status
- Requires `DEVIN_API_KEY` environment variable

Usage:
```bash
export DEVIN_API_KEY="your-api-key"
./scripts/force-rebuild.sh
```

### Configuration Monitor
Location: `scripts/config-monitor.js`

Client-side monitoring script that:
- Verifies API URL configuration matches expected value
- Tests backend connectivity every 5 minutes
- Automatically reloads page if configuration issues detected
- Sends alerts for configuration mismatches

## GitHub Actions Workflow

### Automated Build Process
Location: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

The workflow:
1. Sets up Node.js 18 and pnpm
2. Builds frontend with production environment variables
3. Prepares build artifacts for deployment
4. Note: GitHub Actions cannot directly deploy to Devin Apps Platform

Environment variables used in build:
```yaml
env:
  VITE_API_URL: https://api.yourchoiceice.com
  VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY || '' }}
```

## Vercel CLI Failures - IGNORE

### Known Issues
As documented in `vercel-deployment-issue.md`, Vercel deployments are failing due to:
- Configuration conflicts between `builds` and `functions` properties
- Framework detection issues
- Empty vercel.json causing JSON parsing errors

### Resolution Strategy
**IGNORE ALL VERCEL CLI FAILURES** - The project has been successfully migrated to Devin Apps Platform deployment. Vercel is no longer the primary deployment method.

Current status from `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md`:
- ✅ Frontend: Configured for Devin platform deployment
- ✅ Backend: Running on Fly.io with api.yourchoiceice.com domain
- ✅ Configuration: All Vercel references removed
- ✅ Build: Successfully builds with all dependencies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Dashboard Loading Issues**
   - Ensure `VITE_API_URL` is set during build time
   - Verify backend API is accessible at https://api.yourchoiceice.com
   - Check browser console for CORS errors

2. **Environment Variable Problems**
   - Vite requires environment variables at build time, not runtime
   - Use `VITE_API_URL=https://api.yourchoiceice.com pnpm build` for manual builds
   - Verify variables are embedded in build artifacts

3. **API Connectivity**
   - Test backend health: `curl https://api.yourchoiceice.com/healthz`
   - Check CORS configuration on backend
   - Verify SSL certificates are valid

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Test frontend build
cd frontend && pnpm build

# Verify API URL in build artifacts
curl -L https://yourchoiceice.com | grep "api.yourchoiceice.com"

# Test backend connectivity
curl -s https://api.yourchoiceice.com/healthz

# Check deployment status
curl -s "https://api.devin.ai/v1/apps/ice-management-app-4r16aafs/deployments" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEVIN_API_KEY"
```

```

## Security Considerations

- Environment variables are properly scoped to production/preview environments
- HTTPS is enforced via SSL configuration
- API keys are stored as secrets, not in plain text
- CORS is configured on backend to allow yourchoiceice.com origin

## Future Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. Monitor deployment status via GitHub Actions
2. Update environment variables as needed via `devin.appconfig.json`
3. Test key functionality after each deployment
4. Review and update this documentation as the deployment process evolves

### Emergency Procedures
1. Use `scripts/force-rebuild.sh` for immediate redeployment
2. Check backend status at https://api.yourchoiceice.com/healthz
3. Monitor client-side errors via browser console
4. Escalate to Devin platform support if deployment fails
