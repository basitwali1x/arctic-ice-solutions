# Deployment Resources for Arctic Ice Solutions

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive deployment resources for the Arctic Ice Solutions frontend using Devin Apps Platform.

## Current Deployment Status

### ✅ Successfully Deployed
- **Current URL**: https://frontend-deployment-app-0vfk8kvg.devinapps.com
- **Status**: Live and accessible
- **Platform**: Devin Apps Platform
- **Backend API**: https://api.yourchoiceice.com

### ⚠️ Custom Domain Configuration - PARTIAL SUCCESS
- **Target Domain**: https://yourchoiceice.com
- **SSL Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Cloudflare proxy provides SSL termination
- **DNS Status**: ✅ Successfully updated CNAME record to point to current deployment
- **Current Issue**: 404 routing error - Frontend application not loading at custom domain
- **App ID**: `ice-management-app-4r16aafs` (configured in devin.appconfig.json)
- **Root Cause**: Custom domain routing issue - SSL works but application paths return 404
- **Force Rebuild Script**: ❌ Still fails with "Not Found" errors, app ID may not exist
- **Impact**: SSL certificate error resolved, but frontend application not accessible at yourchoiceice.com

### Environment Configuration
Production environment variables are configured in `devin.appconfig.json`:
```json
{
  "appId": "ice-management-app-4r16aafs",
  "environments": {
    "production": {
      "envVars": {
        "VITE_API_URL": "https://api.yourchoiceice.com",
        "VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY": "$GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  },
  "domains": ["yourchoiceice.com"]
}
```

## Deployment Process

### 1. Build Frontend Locally
```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### 2. Deploy to Devin Apps Platform
Use the deploy_frontend command with the built assets:
```bash
# Deploy the dist directory to Devin Apps Platform
deploy_frontend dir="/path/to/frontend/dist"
```

### 3. Current Deployment Results
- ✅ **Deployed URL**: https://frontend-deployment-app-0vfk8kvg.devinapps.com
- ✅ **Frontend Loading**: Arctic Ice Solutions login page displays correctly
- ✅ **Demo Credentials**: All user roles visible on login page
- ⚠️ **API Connectivity**: Login attempts return "Invalid username or password"
- ❌ **Custom Domain**: yourchoiceice.com shows certificate error

### 4. CRITICAL ISSUE: Custom Domain Configuration
**Problem**: The `deploy_frontend` command creates new deployments with generated URLs instead of using the configured app ID that has the custom domain setup.

**Current Status**:
- ❌ yourchoiceice.com returns certificate error (ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID)
- ❌ Site only accessible at generated URL: https://frontend-deployment-app-0vfk8kvg.devinapps.com
- ✅ App ID `ice-management-app-4r16aafs` configured in devin.appconfig.json with yourchoiceice.com domain
- ✅ Frontend builds correctly with production API URL

**SSL Certificate Solution - COMPLETED**:
✅ **Cloudflare Proxy Enabled**: Successfully resolves SSL certificate error
- Script: `enable_cloudflare_proxy.py` 
- Result: yourchoiceice.com now accessible without ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID
- SSL termination handled by Cloudflare proxy

**Remaining Issue - Frontend Routing**:
❌ **404 Error**: yourchoiceice.com returns "404 page not found" for all paths
- Original deployment works: https://frontend-deployment-app-0vfk8kvg.devinapps.com
- Custom domain SSL works but application routing fails
- May require platform-level routing configuration or deployment to proper app ID

**User Impact**: User frustrated with weeks of domain switching issues - needs permanent yourchoiceice.com setup to avoid "going round and round again"

## Automated Deployment Scripts

### Force Rebuild Script
Location: `scripts/force-rebuild.sh`

This script provides manual deployment automation:
- Updates environment variables via Devin API
- Triggers rebuild with cache clearing
- Monitors deployment status
- Requires `DEVIN_API_KEY` environment variable

Usage:
```bash
export DEVIN_API_KEY="your-api-key"
./scripts/force-rebuild.sh
```

### Configuration Monitor
Location: `scripts/config-monitor.js`

Client-side monitoring script that:
- Verifies API URL configuration matches expected value
- Tests backend connectivity every 5 minutes
- Automatically reloads page if configuration issues detected
- Sends alerts for configuration mismatches

## GitHub Actions Workflow

### Automated Build Process
Location: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

The workflow:
1. Sets up Node.js 18 and pnpm
2. Builds frontend with production environment variables
3. Prepares build artifacts for deployment
4. Note: GitHub Actions cannot directly deploy to Devin Apps Platform

Environment variables used in build:
```yaml
env:
  VITE_API_URL: https://api.yourchoiceice.com
  VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY || '' }}
```

## Vercel CLI Failures - IGNORE

### Known Issues
As documented in `vercel-deployment-issue.md`, Vercel deployments are failing due to:
- Configuration conflicts between `builds` and `functions` properties
- Framework detection issues
- Empty vercel.json causing JSON parsing errors

### Resolution Strategy
**IGNORE ALL VERCEL CLI FAILURES** - The project has been successfully migrated to Devin Apps Platform deployment. Vercel is no longer the primary deployment method.

Current status from `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md`:
- ✅ Frontend: Configured for Devin platform deployment
- ✅ Backend: Running on Fly.io with api.yourchoiceice.com domain
- ✅ Configuration: All Vercel references removed
- ✅ Build: Successfully builds with all dependencies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Dashboard Loading Issues**
   - Ensure `VITE_API_URL` is set during build time
   - Verify backend API is accessible at https://api.yourchoiceice.com
   - Check browser console for CORS errors

2. **Environment Variable Problems**
   - Vite requires environment variables at build time, not runtime
   - Use `VITE_API_URL=https://api.yourchoiceice.com pnpm build` for manual builds
   - Verify variables are embedded in build artifacts

3. **API Connectivity**
   - Test backend health: `curl https://api.yourchoiceice.com/healthz`
   - Check CORS configuration on backend
   - Verify SSL certificates are valid

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Test frontend build
cd frontend && pnpm build

# Verify API URL in build artifacts
curl -L https://yourchoiceice.com | grep "api.yourchoiceice.com"

# Test backend connectivity
curl -s https://api.yourchoiceice.com/healthz

# Check deployment status
curl -s "https://api.devin.ai/v1/apps/ice-management-app-4r16aafs/deployments" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEVIN_API_KEY"
```

```

## Security Considerations

- Environment variables are properly scoped to production/preview environments
- HTTPS is enforced via SSL configuration
- API keys are stored as secrets, not in plain text
- CORS is configured on backend to allow yourchoiceice.com origin

## Future Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. Monitor deployment status via GitHub Actions
2. Update environment variables as needed via `devin.appconfig.json`
3. Test key functionality after each deployment
4. Review and update this documentation as the deployment process evolves

### Emergency Procedures
1. Use `scripts/force-rebuild.sh` for immediate redeployment
2. Check backend status at https://api.yourchoiceice.com/healthz
3. Monitor client-side errors via browser console
4. Escalate to Devin platform support if deployment fails
