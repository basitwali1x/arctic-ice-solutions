# Google Play Deployment Test

This file is created to test the Google Play deployment workflow after fixing the service account permissions.

## Service Account Permission Fix Applied

âœ… **RESOLVED**: Added service account `play-store-deployment@fiery-emblem-467622-t0.iam.gserviceaccount.com` to Google Play Console with Admin permissions.

This should resolve the "caller does not have permission" error during deployment.

## Test Timestamp
- Test initiated: August 13, 2025 02:55:11 UTC
- Branch: main
- Purpose: Verify service account permission fix

## Expected Result
The Android deployment workflow should now successfully authenticate with Google Play Console and upload AAB files without permission errors.
