Android deployment force trigger for main branch created at: 2025-08-12T01:17:54Z

This file was created to force trigger the Android CI/CD workflow on the main branch
after PR merge, since the auto-merge action doesn't generate push events.

The previous PR #104 was successfully merged but didn't trigger the Android workflow
on main due to the limitation of juliangruber/merge-pull-request-action@v1.

This will ensure both Android apps deploy to Google Play Store internal track:
- Customer app: com.arcticeicesolutions.customer  
- Staff app: com.arcticeicesolutions.staff
