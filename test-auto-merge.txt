This is a test file to verify that the auto-merge workflow fix is working correctly.

The auto-merge workflow should:
1. Trigger on both pull_request and check_suite events
2. Auto-merge PRs from devin-ai-integration[bot]
3. Generate a push event to main branch
4. Trigger the Android CI/CD workflow on main branch
