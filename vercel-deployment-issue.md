# Fix Vercel Deployment Configuration

## Issue Description
The Vercel deployment checks are failing across all 4 deployment targets due to configuration issues. This is a pre-existing problem unrelated to the Android workflow changes that were recently merged.

## Current Status
- ❌ Vercel – arctic-ice-solutions (Deployment failed)
- ❌ Vercel – employee-portal (Deployment failed) 
- ❌ Vercel – customer-portal (Deployment failed)
- ❌ Vercel – frontend (Deployment failed)

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Empty vercel.json**: The main vercel.json file was initially empty, causing "Could not parse File as JSON" errors
2. **Configuration conflicts**: Initial attempts to fix included both `builds` and `functions` properties, which Vercel doesn't allow together
3. **Framework detection**: Vercel may be having issues detecting the correct framework and build configuration

## Current vercel.json Configuration
```json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "frontend/package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build"
    }
  ],
  "env": {
    "VITE_API_URL": "https://api.yourchoiceice.com",
    "VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY": ""
  }
}
```

## Next Steps Required
1. **Investigate project structure**: Determine which frontend application should be deployed via the root vercel.json
2. **Check Vercel dashboard**: Review deployment logs for specific error messages beyond the generic "functions-and-builds" link
3. **Environment variables**: Ensure all required environment variables are configured in the Vercel dashboard
4. **Framework configuration**: Verify that Vercel is correctly detecting the Vite/React framework
5. **Build commands**: May need to specify explicit build commands in vercel.json

## Working Examples
The subdirectories have working vercel.json configurations:
- `arctic-enhancements-package/customer-portal/vercel.json`
- `arctic-enhancements-package/onboarding/vercel.json`

These can be used as reference for the correct configuration structure.

## Priority
Medium - These deployment failures don't block the Android workflow functionality but should be resolved for proper frontend deployment.
